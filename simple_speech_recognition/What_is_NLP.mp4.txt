Can Alexa be your best buddy? Well, not now, but probably very soon. We have been seeing gigantic leaps over the last couple of years in terms of how computers can understand and use natural language. This is all thanks to the sub discipline of AI called natural language processing, or NLP for short. Under its umbrella, there are many tasks that we have conquered already to a good degree, like machine translation, text classification, sentiment analysis, or summarization. But the ultimate goal is to make a model that can encapsulate the actual essence of language. As we make better and better models, we get closer to unlocking a whole new set of data to make it even better systems and make it easier for humans to communicate with these systems, no matter how tech savvy they are or not. How are these models made? Well, mostly with convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Sometimes we have some variations of these two and very recently transformer models with attention mechanisms on them, and it's not hard to include NLP in your projects. You can use NLP APIs as a service or include a model by fine tuning it to your specific problem.
